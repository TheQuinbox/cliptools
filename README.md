# cliptools

An NVDA add-on for managing the clipboard.

## Keys

* NVDA+E: Bring up the clipboard editor. From here, you can read and edit the text on your clipboard. When done, press the OK button.
* NVDA+shift+c: Clear the clipboard of all it's content. If the clipboard is already empty, a message will be spoken.

## Todo

* Add automatic reading of clipboard content changes.
* Reimplement clipcopy directly into this addon.
* Add messages after pressing the OK button in the editor.
* Add the ability to press escape in the editor. NVDA's log viewer has code for this inside of it somewhere.
